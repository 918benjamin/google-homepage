This is my first project for The Odin Project.
I am recreating the Google homepage to practice HTML and CSS.

View this project hosted on Github: https://918benjamin.github.io/google-homepage/

Future todo list:
- Add magnifying glass and microphone icons to the search bar
- Make the page responsive
- Audit for accessibility and make necessary changes
- Mimic autofill at least the initial autofill before typing
- Mimic the hover function of "I'm feeling lucky" button
